Distributed data stream mining has gained increasing attention in recent years since many organizations collect tremendous amounts of streaming data from different locations. Existing studies mainly focus on learning evolving concepts on distributed data streams, while the privacy issue is little investigated. In this paper, for the first time, we develop a federated learning framework for distributed concept-drifting data streams, called FedStream. The proposed method allows capturing the evolving concepts by dynamically maintaining a set of prototypes with error-driven  representative learning. Meanwhile, a new metric-learning-based prototype transformation technique is introduced to preserve privacy among participating clients in the distributed data streams setting. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the superiority of FedStream, and it even achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art distributed learning methods.
